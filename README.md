## Overview

WasReal is a tool that allows you to explore, edit, and export your personal BeReal data. Have you ever wanted to create a personal archive of your BeReal memories?

WasReal makes it easy to extract your BeReal pictures and save it in a format that you can use for other purposes.

## Getting Started

### 1. Request Your Data from BeReal

First, you'll need to request a copy of your BeReal data. Here's how:

**On iOS:**

1.  Go to **Settings > Help > Contact Us > Report a Problem > Other > Still need help?**
2.  Tap **'Select a topic'** and choose **'I'd like to request a copy of my data'**.
3.  Fill in the required fields and tap **'Send'**.

**On Android:**

BeReal will send you a support message with a download link to a zip file containing your data. This process might take a few days.

### 2. Using WasReal

2.  **Edit your data:** Use the intuitive interface to view and modify your BeReal data.
3.  **Export your data:** Download your edited data in various formats. (List supported formats: JSON, CSV, etc.)
